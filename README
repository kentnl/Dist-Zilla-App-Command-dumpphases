NAME
    Dist::Zilla::App::Command::dumpphases - Dump a textual representation of
    each phase's parts.

VERSION
    version 0.6.0

SYNOPSIS
      cd $PROJECT;
      dzil dumpphases

      dzil dumpphases --color-theme=basic::plain # plain text
      dzil dumpphases --color-theme=basic::green # green text

DESCRIPTION
    Working out what Plugins will execute in which order during which phase
    can be a little confusing sometimes.

    This Command exists primarily to make developing Plugin Bundles and
    debugging dist.ini a bit easier, especially for newbies who may not
    fully understand Bundles yet.

    If you want to turn colors off, use "Term::ANSIcolor"'s environment
    variable "ANSI_COLORS_DISABLED". E.g.,

    "ANSI_COLORS_DISABLED=1 dzil dumpphases"

    Alternatively, since 0.3.0 you can specify a color-free theme:

        dzil dumpphases --color-theme=basic::plain

TERMINOLOGY
    Technically speaking, this utility deals with more than just "phases",
    it will in fact dump all plugins used, and it will in the process of
    doing so, dump things that are part of the clearly defined "phases" that
    occur within "Dist::Zilla".

    However, if you want to be pedantic, and understand how "Dist::Zilla"
    works, then you must understand, many of the things this module calls
    "phases" are not so much phases.

    At its core, "Dist::Zilla" has an array, on which all "Plugin"s are
    stored.

    A "Plugin", in itself, will not do very much ( at least, not unless they
    do instantiation-time changes like "[Bootstrap::lib]"

    There are 3 Primary kinds of plugin

    *   Auxiliary Plugins

        Plugins which exist to augment other plugins ( For instance,
        "-FileFinder"'s ).

        "Dist::Zilla" itself essentially ignores these, and their
        consumption is entirely regulated by other "plugin"s.

    *   Phase Plugins

        Plugins which hook into a specific and determinate phase of the
        "Dist::Zilla" build/test/release cycle.

        These all provide primary methods, which "Dist::Zilla" directly
        calls somewhere in its core code base.

        Good examples of Phase plugins perform "-FileGatherer"

    *   A Third Kind

        There's a third kind of Plugin, which is somewhere between the other
        two, which I presently lack a name for.

        Like the Phases, they provide primary methods, which are called by
        "Dist::Zilla" directly, and they provide information for
        infrastructural components of the "Dist::Zilla" development process.

        However, they're not strictly "phases", because exactly when they
        will be called ( or if they will be called at all ) is heavily
        dependent on usage.

        For instance, "-VersionProvider", which is dependent on a few
        variables, and is called only when its needed, the first time its
        needed.

        Which means it could occur as early as creating "META.json" or it
        could occur as late as just before it writes the distribution out to
        disk.

    This "App::Command" command will indeed list all of the above, but for
    the sake of ease of use, the "Third kind" is informally under the
    umbrella of a "phase".

METHODS
  "opt_spec"
    This command takes one optional parameter

    *   "color-theme"

            dzil dumpphases --color-theme=<THEME>

        The name of a color theme to use.

        Existing themes are:

        *   "basic::blue"

        *   "basic::green"

        *   "basic::red"

        *   "basic::plain"
